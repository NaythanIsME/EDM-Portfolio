  <h1>Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h1>
  <h2>“The world was ending, and only one reader knew what came next.”</h2>

  <div class="narration">
    [#001: Prologue - A Single Reader's Perspective]
  </div>

  <p>As always, the subway was packed. The fluorescent lights above flickered slightly, casting pale shadows across the exhausted faces of the evening crowd.</p>

  <p>Kim Dokja glanced down at his phone, the screen glowing softly with the text of <em>Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse</em>. No one else in this train car knew that the world would end in exactly seven minutes.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    “You’re still reading that weird webnovel?”<br>
    — Yoo Sangah
  </div>

  <p>He smiled faintly. The words on his screen shifted as the latest chapter updated in real time—a chapter that should not exist.</p>

  <div class="narration">
    [<span style="color:#c0392b;">The scenario is beginning.</span>]
  </div>

  <p>The lights went out.</p>
  <p>When they came back, the train had stopped, and something was standing on the tracks. Something not human.</p>

  <div class="dialogue">
    “This isn’t fiction anymore.”<br>
    — Kim Dokja
  </div>

  <div class="credit">
    Inspired by the webnovel "Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint" by Sing Shong.
