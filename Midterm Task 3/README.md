# Midterm Lab Task 3. Creating PIVOT TABLE and DASHBOARD
focusing on building the Dashboard with the necessary Pivot Tables, charts, and interactivity using slicers. I'll break down the steps to ensure clarity:
## Step 1: Data Preparation
1.1 Load the Uncleaned Data
Open the Uncleaned DS Jobs worksheet. Review the raw data carefully for any inconsistencies or missing information. Clean and transform the data where needed (similar to Task 1) by removing duplicates, handling null values, trimming spaces, etc.
1.2 Transform Data into Key Tables
Sal By Role: Create a Pivot Table or summary table to get the total salary by Job Role.

Sal By State: Create a Pivot Table or summary table to get the total salary by State.

Sal by Size: Create a Pivot Table or summary table to get the total salary by Company Size.

## STEP 2 - Design Your Dashboard

2.1 State with the Most Number of Data Science Jobs
Create Pivot Table:

Insert a Pivot Table with State as rows and Count of Data Science Jobs as the values. This will give you the number of data science jobs per state.
Chart Type:

Create a Bar Chart or Map Chart (if available in your Excel version) to display the state with the most Data Science jobs visually.

For Map Chart:

If your version of Excel supports it, use the Map Chart for a geographical representation of the data.
This will automatically group the states and show the job distribution by location.
2.2 Job Role with the Highest Average Salary
Create Pivot Table:

Insert a Pivot Table with Job Role as rows and Average Salary as values.
Ensure that the aggregation function is set to Average for salary values.
Chart Type:

Use a Column Chart to display the job role with the highest average salary. Highlight the job role that has the highest salary in your data.
2.3 Company Size that Pays the Highest
Create Pivot Table:

Insert a Pivot Table with Company Size as rows and Average Salary as values.
Again, ensure that the aggregation function is set to Average for the salary field.
Chart Type:

Use a Bar Chart to visually compare the company sizes based on their average salaries. Highlight the company size that pays the highest salary.
